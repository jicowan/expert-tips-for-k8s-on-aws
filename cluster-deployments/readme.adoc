= Cluster Deployments tips

== General Kubernetes tips

- Never deploy https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way[Kubernetes cluster the hard way]
- Deploy multi-master (at least 3 in separate Availability Zones), multi-node cluster for production deployments. Its okay to deploy single master if you are trying out things
- Deploy at least 3 etcd nodes in separate Availability Zones to manage your Master nodes. Etcd can be part of your master node configuration but good to run separate nodes to prevent blast radius

== Choices of Cluster Deployments

- Community: kops, kubeadm,
- Managed Service: EKS
- Packaged: CoreOS Tectonic(1), Red Hat Openshift (1)
         (1) Commercial offering

=== kops

Kops helps you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain highly available, Kubernetes clusters from the command line

- Fully automated installation
- Deploys Highly Available (HA) Kubernetes Masters
- Self-healing: everything runs in Auto-Scaling Groups
- Community support by SIG AWS
- Available on Github: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops

    $ export AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES=${ZONES:-"us-east-1b,us-east-1c,us-east-1d"}
    $ export KOPS_STATE_STORE="s3://kubernetes-aws-io"
    $ kops create cluster cluster.k8s.local \
      --master-count 3 \
      --master-size m4.large \
      --node-count 5 \
      --node-size m4.large \
      --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
      --networking calico \
      --yes

=== kubeadm

KUBEADM is a toolkit that helps you bootstrap a best-practice Kubernetes cluster in an easy, reasonably secure and extensible way

- By design, Kubeadm cares only about bootstrapping, not about provisioning machines
- Installing various nice-to-have addons, like the Kubernetes Dashboard, monitoring solutions, and cloud-specific addons, is not in scope
- kubeadm expects the user to bring a machine to execute on, the type doesnâ€™t matter, can be a Linux laptop, virtual machine, physical/cloud server or Raspberry Pi
- This makes kubeadm well suited to integrate with provisioning systems of different kinds (e.g. Terraform, Ansible, etc.)

    # Install kubeadm on your hosts,
    # for example - ubuntu, debian:
    $ apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
    $ curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
    $ cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
    deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
    EOF
    $ apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl

    # Initialize your master nodes
    $ kubeadm init

    # Install pod network, for example - calico:
    $ kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.0/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/kubeadm/1.7/calico.yaml

    # To join your worker nodes to the cluster, run the
    # output of kube init command
    $ kubeadm join --token <token> <master-ip>:<master-port> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>

=== EKS

EKS is managed Kubernetes service from AWS. It offers highly available master  and etcd nodes and automated version upgrades and patching for the masters

- Highly available masters deployed across three availability zones
- Platform for enterprises to run production-grade workloads
- Provides a native and upstream Kubernetes experience
- Not forced to use additional AWS services, but offer seamless integration
- Actively contributes to the Kubernetes project

    $ aws eks create-cluster \
       --cluster-name <> \
       --desired-master-version <> \
       --role-arn <>
