2. Speaker would clone the https://github.com/dalbhanj/expert-tips-for-k8s-on-aws[repo] locally.
3. Speaker would execute the setup script.
4. Speaker would go to the event.
5. Speaker would open up the list of topics (bit.ly) and then invite attendees to vote on the topics that they would like to learn more about.
6. Wait for attendees to vote ... (30 seconds to 1 minute)
7. Speaker brings up a Kibana dashboard to show the results of the survey
8. Depending on time allocated - 60 or 30 or 45 minute session, the speaker then covers the top 6, 5, 3 topics
